# Dynamic qr codes
A django web app for creating and managing dynamic QR codes. A user can enter a target URL and a short URL. The short URL gets a QR code and redirects web traffic to the target URL. The short URL can be updated after the QR code is generated in order to redirect to a different target URL than the original one.
